            <p>Rice prices in the Philippines continued their downtrend in the first month of 2025, with the inflation rate for the grain staple contracting for the first time in nearly four years, amid a trend of declining global prices and a reduction in rice tariffs mid-last year.

                At a press conference on Wednesday, Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) chief National Statistician Claire Dennis Mapa reported that rice posted a year-on-year deflation of -2.3% in January 2025 from 0.8% increase seen in December 2024.
                
                The trend of easing inflation for rice seen since August 2024 was consistent with the PSA’s expectation that it will begin easing towards the second half of 2024 due to base effects, particularly when it began its uptrend in August 2023, as well as the impact of lower rice import tariff which took effect early July.
                
                Executive Order No. 62, issued by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in June 2024, reduced the tariff rate for imported rice to 15% from 35%.
                
                Mapa said the contraction in rice inflation seen in January was the first time since December 2021’s rice deflation of -0.1%.
